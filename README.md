Resubmitting: Made changes as instructed.

The huge keyboard issue should be resolved; it no longer fires after the initial input, as it checks the Dom node for the disabled attribute to be false first.

On another note: the game is personalized, changing background color every 3 seconds... as a way of distracting the player from his/her concentration.
