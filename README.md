# Techdegree project number 7 React Gallery App

Submitting Project 7: Aiming for Exceeds expectation, but will settle for less.

* App can be started via running npm start

* In order to begin using app, first replace the api_key variable in the App.js file, which is currently supposed to hold a string value that is an api key, with your own personal api key from Flickr. BE SURE TO REMOVE THE IMPORT FUNCTION TRYING TO LOOK FOR A CONFIG FILE IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS METHOD.

* Or you can create a config file inside the src folder that exports an api key. Be sure to establish this file inside the src directory, as react doesn't allow import from outside src.

* Three mainstay search options: cats, dogs, and computers are always available for use, unless you run into an unsupported route, which will display a 404 notice page.

* Back, forward, and Refresh buttons can be used; fetched data query is preserved each time.
